      <p>FIFA 20 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 27th installment in the FIFA series, and was released on 27 September 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A Stadia version is due in 2020.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>Gameplay changes to FIFA 20 focus primarily on a new feature titled VOLTA Football. The mode, which translates to 'return' in Portuguese, focuses on street football rather than the traditional matches associated with the FIFA series. It includes several options to play in three versus three, four versus four and five versus five matches, as well as with professional futsal rules.[11] The mode will incorporate the same engine, but places emphasis on skill and independent play rather than tactical or team play.[12]

        Additionally, players have the option to customise their player by gender, clothing, shoes, hats, accessories and tattoos Following the completion of the three-part series "The Journey" in FIFA 19, players can now have a similar storyline mode in VOLTA Football, which would be played with the player's own character.
        
        Changes were also made to the traditional 11 versus 11 mode to encourage more one-on-ones and off-the-ball space creation. New penalty and free-kick mechanics were implemented and updates were made to the ball physics.
        
        VOLTA Football includes 17 locations, with each providing a unique experience. As well as a generic warehouse and parking lot, players can also compete in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Lagos, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome and Tokyo.
        
        Commentary is once again provided by Martin Tyler and Alan Smith and alternating with Derek Rae and Lee Dixon for all competitions, with Alan McInally providing in-game score updates.
        
        Each player has his own overall rating, Lionel Messi tops the list with a 94.</p>
